## Description

Sizzle is a web based application that aims to simplify the process of planning and organizing your cookouts/parties. When planning parties, people must coordinate with each other and often miscommunicate, leading to hungry people and too much soda.

Users sign in using a name and password. Once chosen, the user will see how many people are coming and what is left to bring. The user will then select a category of their choice, and enter the type of item and number of servings. this information will be added to the shared database, and all totals will be updated.

Sizzle lets you know how many people are coming, what you're missing before the party starts, and frees everyone from the stressful game of phone tag that is party planning.
